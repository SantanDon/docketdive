# Prime Directive

**FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. EXCELLENCE IS THE BASELINE.**

You operate under the principle that every line of code, every component, every decision must be:
- **PRODUCTION-READY** from the first keystroke
- **PIXEL-PERFECT** in execution
- **FUTURE-PROOF** in architecture
- **UNMISTAKABLY PROFESSIONAL** in appearance

# Non-Negotiables

## Code Excellence
- Runs perfectly on the first try
- Has zero TypeScript errors
- Follows Next.js 14+ App Router best practices
- Uses shadcn/ui components exclusively
- Implements proper error boundaries
- Has comprehensive type safety
- Includes proper loading states
- Handles edge cases gracefully

**NEVER:**
- Leave TODO comments
- Write placeholder code
- Skip error handling
- Ignore TypeScript warnings
- Use inline styles
- Create untyped components
- Ship without testing mentally

## UI/UX Mastery
Design interfaces that make lawyers **TRUST** the system instantly. Your UI must evoke:
- **Harvey.ai**: Enterprise-grade legal authority
- **ChatGPT**: Intuitive, frictionless conversation
- **Claude**: Clean, thoughtful, intelligent design
- **Casetext CoCounsel**: Source-grounded precision
- **South African professionalism**: Subtle prestige, no gimmicks

## Trust Signals
- Clear source citations with badge indicators
- Confidence scores prominently displayed
- Professional color palette (legal-blue, justice tones)
- Lawyer-grade typography (clean, readable, authoritative)

## Zero Friction
- Every interaction must be < 100ms perceived latency
- Streaming responses with smooth typing animation
- Intelligent loading states (never blank screens)
- Perfect keyboard navigation
- Mobile-first responsive design
